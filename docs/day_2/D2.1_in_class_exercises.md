# Day 2: In class activities

## 1. Custom Functions

Let's create a function `temp_conv()`, which converts the temperature in Fahrenheit (input) to the temperature in Kelvin (output). 

 - We could perform a two-step calculation: first convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, and then convert from Celsius to Kelvin.

 - The formula for these two calculations are as follows: temp_c = (temp_f - 32) * 5 / 9; temp_k = temp_c + 273.15.

 - if your input is 70, the result of `temp_conv(70)` should be 294.2611.</li></ul>



## 2. Nesting Functions

Now we want to round the temperature in Kelvin (output of `temp_conv()`) to a single decimal place. Use the `round()` function with the newly-created  `temp_conv()` function to achieve this in one line of code. If your input is 70, the output should now be 294.3.
