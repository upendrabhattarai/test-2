## Learning Objectives 

* Apply the custom function to generate consistent plots.

## Consistent formatting using custom functions

When publishing, it is helpful to ensure all plots have similar formatting. To do this we can create a custom function with our preferences for the theme. Remember the structure of a function is:

```r
name_of_function <- function(arguments) {
    statements or code that does something
}
```

Now, let's suppose we always wanted our theme to include the following:

```r
theme_bw() +
theme(axis.title=element_text(size=rel(1.5))) +
theme(plot.title=element_text(size=rel(1.5), hjust=0.5))
```

!!!note "Note"
    You can also combine multiple arguments within the same theme() function:
    ```
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.title=element_text(size=rel(1.5)), plot.title=element_text(size=rel(1.5), hjust=0.5))
    ```

If there is nothing that we want to change when we run this, then we do not need to specify any arguments. Creating the function is simple; we can just put the code inside the `{}`:

```r
personal_theme <- function(){
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=rel(1.5))) +
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=rel(1.5), hjust=0.5))
}
```

Now to run our personal theme with any plot, we can use this function in place of the lines of `theme()` code:

```r
ggplot(new_metadata) +
  geom_point(aes(x=age_in_days, y=samplemeans, color=genotype, shape=celltype), size=rel(3.0)) +
  xlab("Age (days)") +
  ylab("Mean expression") +
  ggtitle("Expression with Age") +
  personal_theme()
```
