# Day 3: In class activities

## Reading in and inspecting data
- Download the data and place the file into the `data` directory.

|Data | Download link |
|:------|:--------|
|Animal data |[Right click & Save link as...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbctraining/Intro-to-R-flipped/master/data/animals.csv){ .md-button}|


 - Read the `.csv` file into your environment and assign it to a variable called `animals`. **Be sure to check that your row names are the different animals.**

- Check to make sure that `animals` is a dataframe.

- How many rows are in the `animals` dataframe? How many columns?


## Data wrangling


 1. Extract the `speed` value of 40 km/h from the `animals` dataframe.

 2. Return the rows with animals that are the `color` Tan.

 3. Return the rows with animals that have `speed` greater than 50 km/h and output only the `color` column. Keep the output as a data frame.  

 4. Change the color of "Grey" to "Gray". 

 5. Create a list called `animals_list` in which the first element contains the speed column of the `animals` dataframe and the second element contains the color column of the `animals` dataframe. 

 6. Give each element of your list the appropriate name (i.e speed and color).

## The `%in%` operator, reordering and matching

In your environment you should have a dataframe called `proj_summary` which contains quality metric information for an RNA-seq dataset. We have obtained batch information for the control samples in this dataset. 

1. Copy and paste the code below to create a dataframe of control samples with the associated batch information

       
 ```r
     ctrl_samples <- data.frame(row.names = c("sample3", "sample10", "sample8", "sample4", "sample15"), date = c("01/13/2018", "03/15/2018", "01/13/2018", "09/20/2018","03/15/2018"))
 ```

2. How many of the `ctrl_samples` are also in the `proj_summary` dataframe? Use the `%in%` operator to compare sample names. <br>

3. Keep only the rows in `proj_summary` which correspond to those in `ctrl_samples`. Do this with the %in% operator. Save it to a variable called `proj_summary_ctrl`.<br>

4. We would like to add in the batch information for the samples in `proj_summary_ctrl`. Find the rows that match in `ctrl_samples`.<br>

5. Use `cbind()` to add a column called `batch` to the `proj_summary_ctrl` dataframe. Assign this new dataframe back to `proj_summary_ctrl`.


## BONUS: Using `map_lgl()`

1. Subset `proj_summary` to keep only the “high” and “low” samples based on the treament column. Save the new dataframe to a variable called `proj_summary_noctl`.

2. Further, subset the dataframe to remove the non-numeric columns “Quality_format”, and “treatment”. Try to do this using the `map_lgl()` function in addition to `is.numeric()`. Save the new dataframe back to `proj_summary_noctl`.
