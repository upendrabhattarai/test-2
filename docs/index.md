## **Description**
This repository has teaching materials for a hands-on **Introduction to R** workshop taught online. The workshop will introduce participants to the basics of R and RStudio. R is a simple programming environment that enables the effective handling of data, while providing excellent graphical support. RStudio is a tool that provides a user-friendly environment for working with R. These materials are intended to provide both basic R programming knowledge and its application for increasing efficiency for data analysis.
